— Working title —<br><br>

<i>‘The 1561 days of Jan Piot, Fritz Kraut, Pierre Poilu en Tommy Atkins’</i><br><br></center><br>

<b>To mark the remembrance of the First World War, Geert Schoonbeek has initiated a project comprising of sound, word and image.</b><br><br>

Soldiers’ experiences in the First World War are recorded in numerous poems, stories and (soldiers) songs written by war poets and writers, more often than not at the front lines of battle. At the same time, the experiences and fears of the home front, were recorded in just as many literary works. Together these works present an impression of all that took place during the Great War.<br><br>
The sound poet, Geert Schoonbeek has taken these written experiences and used them as a basis for a composition lasting 75 minutes. He strives to allow the memory of those who gave their lives in the Great War, to live on in an image created in sound where the spectator can become a part of the whole.
The graphic artist Bas Geerts shows in his (textual) projections the feelings of the home front; image and sound come together and create a powerful symbiosis.
Dramatic Tenor Arnold Bezuyen is involved, as well as developing the concept, to project and convey the emotions from the trenches.<br><br>
<b>Content</b><br>
The poems and texts as used shall form the core of the dramatic progression of this piece as live documentary is interwoven with strips of immortal soldiers songs.  These poems and texts shall sketch the progress of the war in all it’s expression of emotion:  Intoxication, the bravado, heroism, the numbness, loneliness, fear, panic, shell-shock, death etc. Central to this project is the insanity which prevails in every mechanized war. It’s roots are to be found in the Great War and has taken possession of every war since.<br><br>
How the piece progresses is also how wars progress: In the beginning it isn’t very serious....”a fresh, fun, short war” is the expectation. As time passes this is replaced with feelings of cynicism and sarcasm.  In the middle of the piece we find ourselves in the ‘loneliness’.
Then it gets serious. Shell-shock, suicide, pain; the harsh reality called war. It is the composers intention to grasp the publics imagination and let them leave the performance admitting to themselves that this is something the didn’t know.
In short the public is repeatedly led down the wrong path only to be completely thrown off track when they start to waver.<br><br>

<b>Form</b><br>
In this way the public has the opportunity to see a ‘live documentary’ where they become participants on the battlefield during the Great War. At he same time the public is made aware of the ever present reality of war all around us.<br><br>
Mostly percussion from marching bands will be heard. Over and above the traditional percussion, there will be a specific ‘trench percussion’ used e.g. empty grenade casings, spades an shovels.<br><br>
Texts and images will be used with an historical background, as well as material from the present day. In this way the events of a century ago can be seen in the light of our present situation with regards to war in the world today.<br><br>
<b>Execution</b><br>
1914 – Dulce et Decorum est – 2018 (working title) is a piece of work with a strong international character intended for an international audience. Just as the soldier who was never the same again after his stay in the trenches, so shall the public be who visit this event.<br><br>
